# Family Bank

One bank, one secretery, many members. Anonymously, everyone can put in money to the bank and everyone can take from it. All transactions are only through that one secretery. 

It's a new kind of money - shared money. If you take it, you're taking from others too. it's the Family Bank.

- The secretery is a member too.
