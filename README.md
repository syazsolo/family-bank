# Family Bank

One bank, one secretery, many members. Anonymously, everyone can put in money to the bank and everyone can take from it - No one needs to know. All transactions are only through that one secretery. 

It's a new kind of money - you share it. If you take it, you're taking from others too. it's the Family Bank.

- The secretery is a member too.
